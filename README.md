# Selects

**Post your photo backlog to Instagram, one framed select at a time.**

Selects is a small self-hosted app for photographers with more finished photos than they ever
post. Upload your finals once. On the schedule you set, it picks one, renders it on a frame with
its shutter speed, aperture, ISO and coordinates read from the file, and publishes it to your
Instagram account.

It's early. There is no application yet; the plan is in [docs/PRODUCT.md](docs/PRODUCT.md).

- One container, one volume, SQLite. No other services to run.
- Meant for a home server on a LAN or tailnet, not the open internet.
- One Instagram account per install.
